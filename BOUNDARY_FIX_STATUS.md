# Boundary Loading Fix Status

## Issue Diagnosed
The WorldMap component was trying to load province boundaries from:
1. Regional files that don't exist (`/data/regions/*/province-boundaries_*.json`)
2. New country-based system that only contains country outlines, not provinces

## Solution Applied
1. **Updated WorldMap.tsx** to load from legacy backup files that contain detailed province polygons:
   - `/data/legacy_backup/province-boundaries.json` (contains Canada + others)
   - `/data/legacy_backup/province-boundaries_usa.json`
   - `/data/legacy_backup/province-boundaries_china.json`
   - `/data/legacy_backup/province-boundaries_russia.json`
   - `/data/legacy_backup/province-boundaries_europe_west.json`

2. **Added fallback system** to country-level boundaries if province boundaries fail

## Expected Results
- Map should now show detailed province polygons instead of rectangles
- All countries with province data should be visible
- Interactive province selection should work properly

## Files Changed
- `src/components/WorldMap.tsx` - Fixed boundary loading logic
- `src/components/BoundaryFixTest.tsx` - Added test component
- `src/App.tsx` - Added test component to loading screen

## Verification Steps
1. Check browser console for boundary loading messages
2. Verify province count in loading logs
3. Confirm map shows actual province shapes
4. Test province clicking and selection
